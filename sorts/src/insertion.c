/*  Insertion sort.
    For each element in a list, swap "backward" until it is no longer
    gt/lt its "predecessor". The procedure described above is one of
    the way insertion sort works, but the "for each" can also be
    interperted as "when a number is 'appended' to the list", thus
    insertion sort can also be an "online" sorting algorithm.
    Other advantages include:
    - In-place
    - Stable
    - Simplicity(though complexity is O(n^2))
    - Adaptive, fast if list is near-sorted.
